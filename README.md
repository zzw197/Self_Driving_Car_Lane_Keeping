Implement PID and Pure pursuit control methods for vehicle longitudinal and lateral control.\
Longitudinal control is done by using PID method for controlling the throttle to keep for reference speed.\
Laterial control is done by using pure pursuit method for keeping on the waypoints.\
Codes are implemented in CARLA Simulator python API. The result video can be found at link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oofu6lZkjm0
